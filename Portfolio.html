            <h1><br>Previous Projects</h1>
            <p>I have experience in number different languages completing different project in different languages already.</p>
            <h2>JAVA</h2>
            <p>The first language I will showcase is java. This is the first language I fully dived into when starting out programming.<br>
            I started learning java to program on my high school's FRC team which pushed me to learn more advanced concepts I may not have<br>
            investigated had I not been on the team, such as vision tracking and processing. To highlight this I have linked my teams github page where we<br>
            uploaded our code. I had a large personal investment in programs between the years of 2013 and 2017. <a href="https://github.com/FRC3929AtomicDragons" target="_blank">FRC JAVA CODE</a></p>
            <h2>PHP and mySQL</h2>
            <p>For my senior year project I worked with three other students to create the back-end and partial front-end<br>
            of a service similar to airbnd or bookings.com. PHP and mySQL were used to create and maintain the database holding the information for a given users account<br>
            including things such as usernames, reservations and ratings. We even implemented our own version of encryption to keep<br>
            sensitive information such as credit card information private.</p>
            <h2>HTML and CSS</h2>
            <p>Other than the front end for the aforementioned service I have fully programmed and implemented this website<br>
            using HTML and CSS. Other than that I have few other projects worth mentioning in this section</p>
            <h2>Ruby, Python, etc</h2>
            <p>ruby and python are both languages I don't have a full project done and ready to show as I've never felt<br>
            the need to work a full project with either language. These are both scripting languages I might use as a quick<br>
            one off to test something else. Although I have taught classes on these languages along with classes on HTML and CSS<br>
            Java and other languages.</p>
